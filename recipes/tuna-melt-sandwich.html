    <p>This is dedicated to all those chefs who tell you to never, ever mix fish and cheese together;<br>
         and yet there they are, at the diner at 2:00 in the morning. And you know what they eat?<br>
         Tuna melts. And the reason they do is because it is delicious. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 jar oil-packed tuna, drained</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced green onion</li>

        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Place tuna into a mixing bowl and lightly break apart with a fork.<br>
             Add green onion, celery, capers, chile paste, and mayonnaise. Pinch small pieces from<br>
              mozzarella cheese into the tuna salad and stir to mix. Season with salt and black pepper;<br>
               refrigerate tuna salad until needed.</li>

        <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Broil buttered bread until golden brown on top, 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
             Flip bread slices and broil other side until toasted, 2 to 3 more minutes.<br>
              Remove from oven and turn bread slices over on the baking sheet so the darkest sides are on the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Gently spread tuna salad onto bread slices using 2 forks. <br>
            Press the salad onto the bread and spread tuna all the way to the edges of the bread.<br>
