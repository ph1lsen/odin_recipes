    <h1>Lasagne</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Back</a>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <img src="images/image.webp" width="250px" height="250px">
    <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the <br>
        Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes<br>
         suggested to me by people from the area, such as which<br>
          meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not.<br>
           One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets.<br>
            These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without<br>
             garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            </ul>

             <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/3 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour</li>
                <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>

            </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered,<br>
             1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have<br>
              softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring<br>
               and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; <br>
            pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape.<br>
             Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br>
             Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours. <br>
            Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach and cover until it returns to a boil.<br>
             Stir gently and cook until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with a fork <br>
            to squeeze out as much water and possible; reserve the liquid. Puree spinach in a blender until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Sift flour into a bowl. Make a well in the center; add eggs, spinach,<br>
             and about 1 tablespoon of the reserved liquid. Mix together by hand or using the dough hook of a stand mixer,<br>
              adding more liquid if needed. Knead until dough becomes a smooth ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at<br>
               room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Taste the ragu and adjust salt. Remove from heat and add milk; stir well and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Divide pasta dough into 4 equal sections. Use a pasta machine, or rolling pin,<br>
             dusted with flour, to roll pasta into 1/16-inch thick sheets. <br>
             Lay sheets on clean dish towels to help them dry. Let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Do not allow it to brown or burn.<br>
             Add flour and whisk constantly until golden. Add 1/2 cup milk, whisking constantly. Repeat with remaining milk.<br>
              Simmer until bechamel is thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with nutmeg and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 10:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 11:</strong> Spread a bit of the ragu sauce over the base of a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br>
             Add a layer of pasta. Top with a spoonful of sauce and bechamel. Add a spoonful of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.<br>
              Top with another layer of pasta. Add more sauce, bechamel, and cheese. Repeat layers until you reach the top;<br>
               finish with a layer of pasta, bechamel, and cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 12:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese on top has browned,<br>
             25 to 30 minutes. Let lasagne rest for 10 or 15 minutes at room temperature before slicing.</li>
